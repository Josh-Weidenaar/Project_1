# Summary:

With stay-at-home orders imposed due to COVID-19, it is clear that the USA economy took a significant plunge with the restaurant industry being the most heavily impacted. Perhaps, the question we may all ask at this point is how bad? We seek to discover the severity of this impact on Chicago restaurants and its workers.

We conducted an analysis on COVID-19's impact on the dining industry in Chicago, as well as the specific neighborhoods affected. This analysis can inform and help policy makers, business owners, and other interested parties visualize the impact of the pandemic on Chicago restaurants.
