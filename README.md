# Summary:

With stay-at-home orders imposed due  to COVID-19, it is clear that the USA economy got hit. One of the industry that got impacted the most was the restaurant industry. Perhaps, the question we may all ask at this point is how bad? 

To answer this question, We conducted an analysis on the impact COVID-19 had on the dining industry in the chicagoland, as well as the neighborhoods affected. We believe, this analysis can inform and help, policy makers, business owners, and other interested parties vizualise the impact of the pandemic on the chicago Restaurants industry. We also want to shed light on how mobility and consumer expenditures were impacted by the prevalence of Covid-19 in Chicago neighborhoods
we hope to uncover the many ways Covid-19 has upended the way of life for many Chicagoans and those most impacted
